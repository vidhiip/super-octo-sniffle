Both ways work so pick whichever works better for you! After you multipled or added you should have gotten 75 cents.

If you add the dimes (10 cents) three times, you get 30 cents. If you add the lone quarter (25 cents) just once, you get 25 cents (remember it's a single quarter!). Now, lets add of those individual sums, so it the numbers would be: 10, 30, 25, and 7!
